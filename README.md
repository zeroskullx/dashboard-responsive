# Responsive Dashboard
Responsive Admin Dashboard For an Ecommerce Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this code, I used modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully responsive admin panel with light and dark theme functionality. I used CSS Variables, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Media queries for the responsive design and CSS transitions and animations for some cool animation effects.
